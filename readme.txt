In this project i using gulp bulder, sass, and some other stuffs:

To run as local server use cmd command "gulp"("gulp watch" is set to default).
To compile in production version, use "gulp build".

To swap from 4 cases to 3 cases, pick 3rd menu from title-navigation(Paid Media).
To set hover color, in src(http:// ....), add hash(6 digits in the end of link, after #), to make this color binded on hover case.
